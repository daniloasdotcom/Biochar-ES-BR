Biochars have drawn the attention of Soil Science to the understanding of their effects on the chemical, physical and biological attributes of soils. The State of Espírito Santo has, within the areas of agricultural production, materials that are generated in large volume and with the potential to be used for energy conversion and consequent production of biochars to return to the field as soil conditioners. The present study is a continuation of the research developed within the soil laboratory of the Centro de Ciências Agrarias e Engenharias of the Federal University of Espírito Santo in order to obtain insights into the effectiveness of the use of organic residues and to present solutions for the efficient use of fertilizers in soils. highly weathered.
